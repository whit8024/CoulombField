CoulombField
============

The CoulombField application

This is the server portion of the assignment. To use, just run the code (VS 2010 on Windows XP).
If the firewall blocks ports, you may need to disable the firewall.
To remove or change deadbanding, change the value of the constant THREASHOLD (0 is no deadbanding, 1 is absolute deadbanding).
No changes are needed to address multiple clients.
